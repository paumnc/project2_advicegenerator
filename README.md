## what I learned 

I think the most important thing that I learned is the javascript code. Learning the async await function is helpful in generating random quotes, songs, pictures etc. Especially the part when I deploy my site and if I click the button faster, the advice is showing in the console but not in the site itself. I asked in [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and they said it's about the limit of 5 concurrent requesst in my browser. But it works just fine. 

I also enjoyed doing the HTML and CSS codes. I created a simple media query for smaller view like iphones.
